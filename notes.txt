    /. ability to check multiple things per elort in webElorts
      /. i.e. multiple search starts and search ends
      /. check the last 5 instead of first five (or reverse the list)
        /. some pages have new things in the bottom instead of the top
    . maybe keep track of how many matches there were and if it goes different, then ping
    /. check n items instead of the current version, where its strictly 5
      /. what is the size limit in dweet?
    /. only use 1 dweet key for webelorts
      /. key + "something" is the other key
    /. n dweets each under some specific size limit- 2000 characters
      /. string.chars().count() - O(n)
    . webElorts crashes if dweet links dont return stuff,
      . message on discord about this?
      /. add a func that fixes this using the json file
        /. -d key -j /path (or something)
    . remElorts dosent execute at uniform time steps, maybe
      update the message of the default reminder with exec time
      and add another func that posts this on discord or something
      so i can check on it
    . do tuples work with structopts?
      . maybe try if variable inputs works
      . for time and date (int, int, int) or something
