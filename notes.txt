    . HANDLE THE ERRORS PROPERLY
    . do i really need to keep the texts in dweet?
    . remove useless comments and remove jankness
    . some nice way to toggle debug prints with a flag
      . a macro would be nice instead of if debug println!(....)
        . debug!(text) - this takes care of the "{:?}" and the debug flag things
    . take &[T] input instead of Vec<T> (confirm first why this happens)
    . better way to turn off alerts in webelorts
      . maybe another field? in WebElorts
    . maybe nested searches? in webelorts
      . like search between this and this and then search another time in this text
    . maybe keep track of how many matches there were and if it goes different, then ping
    . webElorts crashes if dweet links dont return stuff,
      . message on discord about this?
    . remElorts dosent execute at uniform time steps, maybe
      update the message of the default reminder with exec time
      and add another func that posts this on discord or something
      so i can check on it
    . do tuples work with structopts?
      . maybe try if variable inputs works
      . for time and date (int, int, int) or something
