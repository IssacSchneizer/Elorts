plan:
    . webElorts crashes if dweet links dont return stuff,
      . message on discord about this?
      . add a func that fixes this using the json file
        . -d key -j /path (or something)
    . remElorts dosent execute at uniform time steps, maybe
      update the message of the default reminder with exec time
      and add another func that posts this on discord or something
      so i can check on it
    . do tuples work with structopts?
      . maybe try if variable inputs works
      . for time and date (int, int, int) or something
