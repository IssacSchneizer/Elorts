takes a look at the reminders and checks to see if the 
reminder is supposed to be completed in the
(current_time + interval ) (basically a less than check)
if yes calls a function with data in that reminder, 
if no calls another function  with the data in that reminder
{
    "title":"Title",
    "text":"text",
    "time":1609309983
}
time is in an integer form
probably normalized or rounded if needed
use the less than and equal to operator
so if time on reminder is less than 
current time + remind duration, notify the discords
